# Hotel Review Sentiment Analysis 
Sentiment analysis is part of the Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques that consists in extracting emotions related to 
some raw texts. This is usually used on social media posts and customer reviews in order to automatically understand if some users
are positive or negative and why.
The goal of this project is to show how sentiment analysis can be performed using python. 
For our classification, we will explore Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.
To extract the frequency of words from the reviews we have used the Term Frequency -Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF) approach.
At last, we will conclude our approach by giving the accuracy of the model.
